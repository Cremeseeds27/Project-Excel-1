### Recommendations for Increasing Revenue

**Insight:**  
To increase revenue from the bottom 10 customers, KMS should consider offering increased discount rates similar to those given to the top 10 customers. This strategy led to increased sales and profit among the top customers and could potentially have the same effect on the bottom customers.

### Shipping Cost Analysis

**Insight:**  
The shipping method with the highest shipping cost is Delivery Truck.

### Most Valuable Customers

**Insight:**  
The most valuable customers are Emily Phan, Deborah Brumfield, and Grant Carroll.

### Corporate Customer Order Analysis

**Insight:**  
The corporate customer who placed the most orders between 2009-2012 is Adam Hart, with a total of 27 orders.

### Most Profitable Consumer Customer

**Insight:**

### Customer Returns Analysis

**Insight:**  
**Consumer Customers:** 17 returned items
**Corporate Customers:** 37 returned items
**Home Office Customers:** 23 returned items
**Small Business Customers:** 10 returned items

### Recommendations for Shipping Methods

**Insight:**  
The delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method, whereas Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive. The company did not appropriately allocate shipping costs based on order priority, as the data shows a preference for Regular Air, which, while not the cheapest, resulted in a reduced cost compared to other shipping methods.
